# push_swap42

## Description:

This repository contains a program written in C that implements a sorting algorithm to arrange a stack of integers in ascending order using a limited set of stack operations. The push-swap algorithm aims to efficiently sort the elements in Stack A while adhering to specific constraints on memory usage and operation counts.

## Key Features:

Implementation of a sorting algorithm using a limited set of stack operations (sa, sb, ss, pa, pb, ra, rb, rr, rra, rrb, rrr).
Two stacks are utilized: Stack A (the initial unsorted stack) and Stack B (an auxiliary stack used for sorting).
Focuses on minimizing the number of operations required to sort Stack A in ascending order.
Emphasizes optimization and efficiency in sorting algorithms, considering memory usage and operation counts.
Interactive and configurable, allowing users to input integers and observe the sorting process.
## Purpose:

Developed as an algorithmic challenge/project to explore sorting techniques and algorithm design using limited operations.
Encourages understanding of various sorting algorithms and their implementation in a constrained environment.
Aims to enhance problem-solving skills, algorithm optimization, and efficient use of available resources.
## Chosen Algorithm:
### Quick Sort => https://www.javatpoint.com/quick-sort

## Usage:

Clone the repository and compile the C source code using a compatible C compiler.
Execute the compiled program, providing a set of integers or generating random integers to observe the sorting process.
Observe the output to analyze the efficiency and number of operations used for sorting.
## Note:

This repository contains a solution specific to the push-swap project requirements and may be part of an educational course or coding challenge.
Contributions, enhancements, or alternative sorting algorithms using the limited set of operations are welcomed.
